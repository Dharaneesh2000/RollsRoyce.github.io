                 <li> Rolls-Royce is synonymous with luxury; the brand is an icon for the very best and truest examples of their kind. The marque has experienced significant change in recent history with an expanded portfolio, an increase in demand for its Bespoke capabilities and the introduction of its Black Badge models. This created an exceptional opportunity to redefine Rolls-Royce’s identity as a luxury brand while asserting its position as the most precious marque in the world. With its unique brand values, it has the power to be a House of Luxury, unlike any other. </li>
                 <li> Rolls-Royce desired to further its appeal to its growing younger and more diverse demographic while respecting the company’s heritage. Based on a strategy developed by the Rolls-Royce team, Pentagram carefully reviewed each element of the existing brand, looking at its design ethos, its designers, items that are sacrosanct to the marque and the unique relationship the marque maintains with its clients. </li>
                 <li>The Spirit of Ecstasy is an iconic figurine (designed in 1909 by sculptor Charles Robinson Sykes) which appears on the prow of every Rolls-Royce. The symbol of luxury was carefully redrawn by the design team to work seamlessly across all offline and online platforms and at a wide range of different sizes. When depicted in this two-dimensional form, her direction has changed from left to right, boldly facing the future, reflective of the marque itself.</li>
                 <li>Placing the Spirit of Ecstasy at the heart of the new brand language marks a shift in resonance from an automotive to a lifestyle context. She commands an aspirational quality in the luxury sphere and, in addition to the motor cars themselves, can now be interpreted as the muse for the marque.</li>
                 <li>As an instantly recognisable stamp of quality, the Monogram also remains the same but replaces the Badge of Honour on collateral. All Rolls-Royce’s trademarks now have a clear and consistent rule of application and composition, giving a coherent brand voice wherever they appear.</li>
